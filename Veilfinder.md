# INTRODUCTION

Veilfinder is a game about mystery, magic, and the masks many (if not all of us) wear - all powered by the Pathfinder Second Edition engine. This is the Game Archive, providing all of the rules to make a character, assemble a party, and play. 

The characters that make up a Veilfinder table are all individuals who have gone past the Masquerade and seen the magic (and evil) beyond the mortal world humanity sees. Wizards, fairies, demons, trolls, angels ... they all exist and you know it. That knowledge is both dangerous and makes you dangerous.

### The Basics

To play Veilfinder, you need 4-6 players and one Narrator. Each player is responsible for a single character in the story, while the Narrator the rest of the world the player's characters interact with. They also keep the story organized and, when necessary, progressing forward - often at the player's peril.
