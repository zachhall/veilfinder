# INTRODUCTION

Veilfinder is a game about mystery, magic, and the masks many (if not all of us) wear - all powered by the *Pathfinder Second Edition* engine. This is the Game Archive, providing all of the rules to make a character, assemble a party, and play. 

The characters that make up a Veilfinder table are all individuals who have gone past the Masquerade and seen the magic (and evil) beyond the mortal world humanity sees. Wizards, fairies, demons, trolls, angels ... they all exist and you know it. That knowledge is both dangerous and makes you dangerous.

### The Basics

To play Veilfinder, you need 4-6 players and one Narrator. Each player is responsible a player's character (PC) in the story, while the Narrator controls the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters for PCs to interact with. They also keep the story organized and, when necessary, progressing forward - often at the player's peril. 

Each player character starts at Level 1 with a set of skills, feats and features that they use to interact with the world whenever there's a chance they might not succeed. The randomness of the world in those instances is represented by dice, usually a twenty sided die (d20). The character's talents augment the dice's results in their favor. 

As character's overcome struggles laid out for them by the Narrator, they gain levels. Levels are gained at the end of a handful of play sessions, usually coinciding with the conclusion of a story arc. With each level, characters gain power. As their power grows, more and more of the Masquerade reveals itself. 

### What is a Hack

Veilfinder is not a complete game by itself and relies on the core rules of *Pathfinder Second Edition* (2e) to function. In fact, calling Veilfinder a "hack" is a stretch - in reality, it's a setting for Pathfinder with some opinionated thoughts on how to best run a Pathfinder game in the setting. The goal of this hack is to allow any 2e content to work in this setting; your wizard, gunslinger and oracle all have a place here Beyond the Veil. 

The primary rule you need to know is simple: if a rule is discussed here, it's usually to add or augment Pathfinder. If a rule isn't discussed, it works the same as it does in Pathfinder. As always, the first rule of Pathfinder is true for Veilfinder: if a rule here doesn't work for you and your group, then change it to ensure everyone is having fun.

## Building a Character

Building a Character for Veilfinder is exactly like building a character in Pathfinder. You'll pick an ancestry, background and class, pick starting equipment, etc. The Veilfinder Game Archive (VGA) has additional character options for you to choose from and some recommended adjustments to things like gold, equipment, and option rarity, but the process is the same. In fact, you could build a Pathfinder character right now, before reading the rest of the VGA, and there's a 95% chance you won't have to change any of your build before jumping Beyond the Veil. 

### Modern Skills for a Modern Age

Veilfinder takes place in the present day, meaning we need a few additional skills that represent modern technology advances that are missing from core Pathfinder. These skills are in addition to the already existing Pathfinder skills and behave as any other skill would behave. Just as in Pathfinder, don't assume that just because someone is not Trained in a skill that they have zero experience with that skill and cannot use them at a basic level. 

If someone is not trained in Computers, that doesn't mean that they have no idea how to use one to perform basic functions like getting directions to an address you acquired on an investigation or sending an email with photo attachments to someone you already know. In the same way, just because someone isn't Trained in Piloting, that doesn't mean that can't drive a car (though, if the player wants to make that a part of their character's backstory they are more than welcome to). Rather, being Trained (or more) in that skill shows the PC's prior specialized training in that and their ability to go above and beyond a vehicle's normal everyday use.
